I have tried to put all the files here that the script actdes_sz.py 

However, the files listed below are simply too big. 

Go to this address to download them, and then put them right here inside the data/ folder. 


lens_maglim_z1.fits
lens_maglim_z2.fits
lens_maglim_z3.fits
lens_maglim_z4.fits

rand_maglim_z1.fits
rand_maglim_z2.fits
rand_maglim_z3.fits
rand_maglim_z4.fits
